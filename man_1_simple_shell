.SH DESCRIPTION
Shell is a UNIX term for the interactive user interface with an operating system. The shell is the layer of programming that understands
and executes the commands a user enters. In some systems, the shell is called a command interpreter. A shell usually implies an interface
with a command syntax. 

.B Overview

The simple_shell is a command-line interpreter that reads input lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and executes other commands. It's the program launched when a user logs into the system. It offers features to assist interactive use and shares an interpretative language between interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts). Commands can be typed directly into the running simple_shell or placed into a file, which can then be executed directly by the simple_shell.
